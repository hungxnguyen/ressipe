  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <h3>How to Make Spring Rolls:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Boil shrimp</strong> according to our boiled shrimp recipe then immediately cool in ice water. Once
      boiled and cooled, drain and cut shrimp in half lengthwise.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cook noodles</strong> according to package instructions until softened (do not overcook) then drain in a
      colander and rinse with cold water. Let noodles drain in a colander until ready to assemble. You can also fill a
      saucepan with water and bring it to a boil, add the noodles, turn off the heat and let them sit in hot water for
      5-7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prep veggies</strong> - julienne cucumbers and carrots, remove stiff stems on lettuce leaves, coarsely
      chop cilantro.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Assemble spring rolls</strong> One at a Time. Fill a shallow round bowl (wider than your wrappers) with
      very warm/hot water. Submerge spring roll wrapper for about 10-15 seconds or until softened(depending on the
      temperature of your water). Place wet spring roll wrapper on a clean and lightly wet cutting board.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add veggies</strong> on one half in this order: lettuce, a generous pinch of noodles, carrots, cucumber,
      cilantro sprigs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Add shrimp</strong> on the second half, placing the shrimp cut-side up.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tightly roll up</strong> the lettuce side first, tuck in the sides then roll over the shrimp so shrimp are
      visible on the outside.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>To serve</strong> - Transfer finished rolls to a serving platter and keep finished spring rolls covered
      with a damp kitchen towel so they do not dry out. For a prettier presentation, serve cut in half on the diagonal.
